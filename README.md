In this project we were tasked to make a quiz with a timer using Javascript.
This was tricky since we needed to create an array of questions that would have an affect on the timer when a question is answered incorrecty.

I'm having an issue with displaying my array of questions after starting the quiz. I also had a hard time understanding how to bring everything together like the timer decreasing time when a questions was wrong.

Also a score and logging the score is not there.
